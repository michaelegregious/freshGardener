 

One of my favorite things to do with my family in the summertime-- with my wife and our 2-1/2 year old-- is to go foraging around our neighborhood for fruit. 

I think most people don't realize, but the city has done a pretty good job of decorating the boulevards and parks with an impressive variety of fruiting trees.

So, for my stackathon app, I thought it would be fun to create a program for crowdsourcing the locations of all the fruit trees in your neighborhood. 

So, here's the boulevard by my house. Most of the fruit trees near us are Serviceberries or Mulberries, but I've taken the liberty of seeding the parkway here with a few other natives that you'll encounter in Chicago.

Here you can view all the trees you've already put down markers for. You can add, edit, remove (if the city comes sadly to take one away). 

Happy foraging.
